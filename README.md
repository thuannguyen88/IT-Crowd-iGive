# iGive

A full stack application to combat food waste, that allows users to give unwanted food to others within the local community. Built using NextJS and hosted on Netlify. Users can upload food items to give away, reserve interest in other items and arrange pick up with other users. The app features user authentication and authorisation via authO. Every user that signs up gets their own unique profile, and all their listings and information can only be edited and deleted by them. You can visit the live site [here](https://igive.netlify.app/.)

  ### Task
  As boot campers we were asked to design an app to solve a problem that we thought stood out for our final four week project.
 
  ### Understanding The Problem
  Took time to understand who the users are and what their problem is

  This project was implemented using an agile process.

  ### Future Vision
  
  ### Reflection
  - Gave me experience what it's like to be part of a real-life engineering team building a real-world solution to a deadline and having fun in the process
  - How important it is to talk with your team ahead of time to establish how the team will handle certain situations and hoe everyone works best 
  - Coding is only part of making a great application, developing is a team sport
